# AD-LIBS
AD-LIBS is a local ancestry inference tool for low-coverage resequencing data. It is described in [this paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1613-0). The goal of AD-LIBS is to take a low-coverage genome from one or more hybrid/admixed individuals, along with one or more low-coverage genomes from representatives of two ancestral populations, and produce a map of where in the genome the hybrid individual derives ancestry from each ancestral population. Maps consist of fixed-width windows across the genome, and each window is labeled as homozygous for ancestry from one or the other ancestral population, or heterozygous for ancestry. Because of this, AD-LIBS is only suited for analysis of diploid organisms.

To circumvent problems with identifying heterozygous sites in low-coverage samples, AD-LIBS reads in one FASTA file per individual. FASTA files must be aligned to the same reference genome and should be "pseudo-haploid," where every base is randomly sampled from one or the other parental haplotype, as has been done in studies like [this one](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003345). To create pseudo-haploid FASTA files, we recommend using the [pu2fa program](https://github.com/Paleogenomics/Chrom-Compare) after mapping reads. 

Results are in [BED format](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1), with a fourth column denoting ancestry in a given window (AA for homozygous population A, AB for heterozygous, and BB for homozygous population B). [BEDTools](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2) contains many programs helpful for downstream analysis of these files.

## Installation

### Python packages
AD-LIBS requires the following Python packages:

- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [pomegranate](https://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

#### Anaconda
An easy way to obtain the first three is to use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), 
which contains these packages.

If using anaconda and they are not installed, try using `conda install`:

`conda install scipy`

`conda install numpy`

`conda install matplotlib`

Note that pomegranate is not available through Anaconda.

#### Pip
These packages are also installable using [Pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip):

`pip install scipy`

`pip install numpy`

`pip install matplotlib`

`pip install pomegranate`

If you do not have root access, you install these packages for your user using the --user flag.

### C programs
AD-LIBS equires gcc for compiling C components, as well as [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) 
for reading compressed [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) files.

To compile C programs, simply type `make` in the main project directory.
Binary files will be stored in `/bin` and run by the main Python program.

Note that `src/kseq.h` is an excellent FASTA parser in C, taken from 
[HTSLib](https://github.com/samtools/htslib), part of the 
[SAMTools](https://github.com/samtools) codebase.

## Running AD-LIBS

The Python program bin/adlibs.py is the main program with which users should interact.
AD-LIBS works in pieces; this program interprets input, `bin/adlibs_score` 
reads in FASTA files and prints out scores computed in windows across sequences, 
and `bin/adlibs_hmm.py` uses the Pomegranate package to build and run the 
Viterbi algorithm on the HMM. Additionally, `bin/allele_freq_drift.py` uses the 
diffusion approximation to the genetic drift problem to compute an important 
probability used by the HMM, and `adlibs_math.py` and `adlibs_dists.py` both 
contain code used by `adlibs_hmm.py`.

`bin/adlibs.py` can use command-line input (run with -h for help) or, since 
the many parameters can get cumbersome, a configuration file containing all 
the information needed for one run. Whether or not you provide a configuration 
file, AD-LIBS will create a new one with all given parameters along with your 
output files, in case you want to run AD-LIBS again with all or most of the 
same parameters.

Note that in order for `bin/adlibs.py` to work, you will need to have 
`python2.7` in your `$PATH` environment variable, or you can run it by 
explicitly including the path to `python2.7` as follows:

`/path/to/python2.7 bin/adlibs.py`

## Example input

The example directory contains an example configuration file, along with 
(short) pseudo-haploid FASTA sequences of genomic scaffolds for two brown bears 
(`OFS01_s317.fa` and `Swe_s317.fa`), two polar bears (`PB12_s317.fa` and 
`PB105_s317.fa`), and two admixed ABC Islands brown bears (`ABC01_s317.fa` and 
`ABC02_s317.fa`). `adlibs.config` contains all the parameters needed to run 
AD-LIBS on this data set, with polar bears as ancestral population "A" and 
brown bears as ancestral population "B". All output will be prefixed with 
"example." and the `adlibs.config` file contains comments explaining the 
parameters.

To run AD-LIBS on this example data set, simply type 
`bin/adlibs.py example/adlibs.config` while in the main project directory. 
When complete, you will see 
[BED files](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat#format1) 
containing results in the example directory. Each line is a genomic window, 
with start and end coordinates, along with a label (AA for homozygous 
population A ancestry, AB for heterozygous ancestry, and BB for homozygous 
population B ancestry). You can try altering parameters and re-running as you 
wish to see how it affects results.

## Citing AD-LIBS

AD-LIBS was described in the article [AD-LIBS: inferring ancestry across hybrid genomes using low-coverage sequence data](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-017-1613-0), NK Schaefer, B Shapiro, and RE Green, BMC Bioinformatics, 2017. We'd appreciate a citation if you use it in your research.
