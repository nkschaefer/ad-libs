allele_freq_drift.py
Created by Nathan Schaefer on 10/26/15 at 10:41

This file contains functions used to calculate the probability of resampling
the same ancestral recombination event twice in an individual, given a 
population size, recombination probability per site, and a number of generations
spanned by a time period of interest.

This was motivated by the need to set transition probabilities in a hidden
Markov model used to infer ancestry of individuals. In order to fully account
for the probability of a given locus representing a transition from 
homozygous ancestry of one type to homozygous ancestry of the other, we need
to know the probability that the individual has inherited the same ancestral
recombination event on both chromosomes.

To solve this problem, recombination events can be thought of as alleles that
arise at frequency 1/(2N) in a diploid population. Since selection does not 
act on recombination events, we are interested in how drift affects their
frequency in a population. The Wright-Fisher model of drift allows one to build
a Markov chain with a transition probability matrix in which each matrix entry
represents the probability of transitioning from i to j copies of an allele
in one generation. The gth power of the matrix then contains, in each [i,j] 
position, the probability of transitioning from i to j copies of an allele over
the course of g generations.

This problem is computationally intractable for large N or g, however, and
continuous approximations exist. We used a solution worked out by McKane and
Waxman (2007) that expands upon the work of Kimura (1955), applying a diffusion
approximation to the genetic drift problem, but including solutions where
the allele frequency is 0 or 2N (loss and fixation). The article is here:
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519307001981

Furthermore, to make computation tractable, we allow multiprocessing and bin
allele frequencies, performing no more than 1000 calculations. This is useful
when population sizes are very large: there is no need to hold all possible
allele frequencies and their probabilities in memory.
